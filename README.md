# House_price_Prediction
I am interested in predicting the rational house price and local rental price to help people purchase a good house. This is my first project in this field, and I will delve into more details and build tools to accomplish that. The code includes implementations of Linear Regression, Lasso, ElasticNet, SVR, and RandomForestRegressor.
